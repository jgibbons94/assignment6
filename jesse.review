Purpose: This file's purpose is to contain Jesse's comments on different pieces of code.
Bucky's code:
QTSpim complains that the word move cannot be used as a label because it is an opcode. I do not know how tolerant MARS is, but I recommend changing the label "move" to something other than "move". It is best to keep these names logical, but the ruberik has a limit on the size of a label.
