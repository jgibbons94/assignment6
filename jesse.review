Purpose: This file's purpose is to contain Jesse's comments on different pieces of code.
Bucky's code:
QTSpim complains that the word move cannot be used as a label because it is an opcode. I do not know how tolerant MARS is, but I recommend changing the label "move" to "move1" and "moves" to "move2" or something like that.
